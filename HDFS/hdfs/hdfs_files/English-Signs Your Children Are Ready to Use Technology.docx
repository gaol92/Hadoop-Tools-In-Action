Today most children start using technology from the early age. Some of them even can`t speak well yet but they already know what computer is and how to use it. The most interesting thing is that they can actually use it correctly in their 4-5 years without any help. The question is what age is really appropriate for using technology? Only a few parents think about it but this question is highly important. So if you want to find out when your children are ready to use all those phones, tablets, laptops and other technological stuff, take a look at these signs¡­

1. They can count
The first thing to pay attention to when you are trying to figure out if your little ones are ready to use technology is an ability to work with numbers. Digital technology is the world of numbers thus a user should have some basic knowledge in maths to be able to use technology correctly. Knowing at least first ten numbers will be enough for your children to have an access to a computer.

2. They know what¡¯s good and what¡¯s bad
Modern technology is impossible without the Internet. Your child should already know what`s good and what`s bad. Looking for something interesting online shouldn`t become the way of getting acquainted with the world around. You`re that very person ¨C not the Internet ¨C who should teach your children useful skills.

3. They know what money is
One of my friends once gave her child a cell phone. There was a free access to the Internet where, as we all know, not every thing is available for free. We know it but our children don`t. Her daughter played with that phone for about an hour and then my friend received a bill for a few thousands of dollars. Her child ordered several online games for cell phones that cost a lot. Therefore, you should better speak about money with your children before they start using technology tools.

4. They can read
Technology is all about reading. It doesn¡¯t matter if you play a video game or look for the answer to your question, something is written there and you wouldn`t manage to use any gadget properly if you can`t read. Reading skill is another sign that your child is ready to use modern technology on their own. Otherwise they`ll either break something or won`t know what to do with all that stuff.
 
5. They`re aware of the safety rules
Technology isn`t always safe. While it`s not dangerous to you, it may damage a child`s health. Make sure that your kids are already aware of the safety rules before you let them use technologies. What to do when the electricity goes out of control? Let your children know this essential information to avoid serious problems.

6. They spend enough time with you
Spending enough time with your children is the key to raising a strong, intelligent and grateful person. If you don`t pay any attention to a child and let them watch the monitor all days long, you let the technology teach them many dangerous things. Children take any information they see for granted. They don`t think what they want to see, they just look at what is shown and think that it`s a natural way of things. You should better go for a walk with your kids and speak to them as often as you can. They need to understand that a real world isn`t what they see on a screen.

7. They have healthy eyes
Before you let a child use cell phones, tablets and computers, it`s better to visit your doctor first. All those screens can significantly ruin a child¡¯s eyesight. But even if you find out that everything is okay with your child`s eyes, it`s anyway better to have a set hours when you allow them to use technology because spending too much time in front of the screen can lead to a number of health issues.

8. They can educate themselves
There`s a huge dirty, unnecessary and not childish content on the Internet, but there are lots of educational programs and games for children as well. It`s better to show your children those useful, colorful games for development. This way, you`ll be sure that your children learns how to use technology, and are also involved in self-development from head to heal.

Nowadays technology is everywhere and you can`t prevent your children from using them but you can control this process. These signs show you that a child is ready to use technology. You shouldn`t hide all the phones and laptops from them, it`s better to make this stuff work for you instead. Teach your kids how to use it correctly and try to show that video games are not everything that we can get out of the last inventions of the technological world but there are lots of useful things to do with it too. Do you think your children are ready to use technology effectively?
